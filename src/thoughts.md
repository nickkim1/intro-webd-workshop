This document just keeps track of various TODOs I might want to implement: 
TODO: add in middleware to the application
TODO: add in user authentication to the application
TODO: refactoring
TODO: understand what the app context has to do with adding in the db tables (create tables whatever)
TODO: finish reorganization
TODO: check compatibility with Firefox Safari mobile etc (mobile should probably be fine)
TODO: add in error handling templates 

Running issue log: 
1. Refreshing causes form to be resubmitted, duplicate info
2. Each delete/add causes a page re-render? 
3. Get rid of weird edit query parameter
4. List index out of range error
5. Duplicate 'unique description needed'
6. Popup (putting styles in .show vs. regular) 

Running Thoughts: 
- Tell them how they should delete the DB in certain cases .. 
- Figure out how relative filepaths in Python work because I have no clue why 
putting the CSS file into static worked while it didn't when I just had it next to the HTML
